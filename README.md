<b>👨‍💻 Hey, I'm Tanvi!</b>

🔮 They say I'm delving into tech like a pro, but let's be real—I'm just making educated guesses, hoping things don't crash (too much). One day, I might actually crack the matrix and understand machine learning and deep learning in their full glory!

<b>🚀 Mission Control:</b> 
I’m navigating through the world of data structures and algorithms, mostly without getting lost. Between Flutter apps, full-stack web projects, and machine learning models, I’m somewhere between “just started” and “might finish this project today...or not.”

<b>🛠️ Tech Gear:</b> 
Flutter | Firebase | Python | Pandas | NumPy | Keras | TensorFlow | React | MERN Stack | Scikit-learn | OpenCV | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | AWS | Jupyter Notebook | Docker | and still Googling stuff!

<b>🌱 Current Adventures:</b> 
Training models, building real-time mobile apps, and occasionally yelling at code when it doesn't cooperate (mostly works afterward).

<b>⚡ Fun Fact:</b> 
I've mastered the art of debugging by taking random breaks and hoping the code fixes itself.
